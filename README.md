# YouTube Player Title Bar Revealer

A Chrome extension which forces the title bar to be displayed in the YouTube
player, regardless of the context. This allows you to access the Watch Later
and Share buttons and see the title all within the player, even when on the
Watch page (usually the title bar is only shown on embedded players or when in
fullscreen).

This Chrome extension simply injects a couple of CSS rules to ensure that the
title bar is always shown.
